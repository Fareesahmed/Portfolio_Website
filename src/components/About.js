          <p className='pb-5'>
            I'm always on the lookout for creative solutions to design challenges, and I'm not afraid to dive into new technologies to achieve my goals. Whether I'm coding something brand new or
            optimizing an existing solution for better performance, I'm happiest when I'm fully submerged in code and work hard to make something awesome!
          </p>
          <p className='pb-5'>I'm most comfortable withs React, Vue.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS, but i never limit myself and I'd be happy to take on a new challenges on an unknown field.</p>
          <p className='pb-5'>
            Beyond the code, you'll find me exploring the world through my camera lens, immersing myself in new cultures and just enjoying life as an adventure. Check out the 'Blog' section of this
            site (life is more than just code, right? ðŸ˜Ž).
